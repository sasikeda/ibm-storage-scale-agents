# IBM Storage Scale Agents

A collection of agents for managing IBM Storage Scale operations. Currently includes a provisioning agent.

## Overview

This collection currently includes the Scale Provisioning Agent, which provides a conversational interface for managing IBM Storage Scale filesets, snapshots, and other storage operations. Built with LangChain and LangGraph, the agents integrate with the IBM Storage Scale MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to execute operations safely with user approval.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [IBM Storage Scale MCP Server](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-storage-scale-mcp-server) running and accessible
- Ollama with a compatible model (default: qwen3:latest)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibm-storage-scale-agents.git
cd ibm-storage-scale-agents
```

2. Install dependencies using uv:
```bash
uv sync
```

Or using pip:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Edit [`config/agents_settings.ini`](config/agents_settings.ini) to configure the agent:

### LLM Configuration
```ini
[llm]
model_name = ollama_chat/qwen3:latest
```

### MCP Server Configuration

**Option 1: HTTP Transport**
```ini
[mcp]
transport = http
url = http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

**Option 2: Stdio Transport**
```ini
[mcp]
transport = stdio
command = /path/to/uv
args = --directory /path/to/scale-mcp-server run scale-mcp-server --transport stdio
```

### Logging Configuration
```ini
[logging]
level = DEBUG
format = json
file_path = logs/agent.log
max_bytes = 10485760
backup_count = 5
```

## Provisioning Agent

For a full reference of supported tools, parameters, and example prompts see the [Provisioning Agent README](src/provisioning_agent/README.md).

## Usage

### Starting the Agent

Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

Or using uv:
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Connection Issues

1. Verify the MCP server is running and accessible

2. Check the transport configuration in [`agents_settings.ini`](config/agents_settings.ini)

3. Review logs in `logs/agent.log` for connection errors

### Model Not Found

Ensure Ollama is running and the model is available:
```bash
ollama list
ollama pull qwen3:latest
```

### Tool Execution Failures

Check that:
- The MCP server has proper IBM Storage Scale API credentials
- The Scale cluster is accessible from the MCP server
- Tool names match those exposed by the MCP server
